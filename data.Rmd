## Raw data 

### Experimental procedures

The data for this study were obtained from experiments using two independent groups of twenty raters each, totaling forty raters. Each group of raters assessed soybean rust severity in a series of fifty soybean leaves in two stepd: first without any aid and second aided by a specific standard area diagram. There was a group of twenty raters assessing severity using a published SAD and another group using a newly-developed SAD. 

### Data structure

The data were stored in `xlsx` files with four spreadsheets, one for each of the four assessments. In those, the data were organized in the wide format with raters in a different column. More details about how the data were prepared in the 'code' webpage.
